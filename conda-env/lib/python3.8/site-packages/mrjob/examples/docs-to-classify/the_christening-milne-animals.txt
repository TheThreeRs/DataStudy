What shall I call
My dear little dormouse?
His eyes are small,
But his tail is e-nor-mouse.
I sometimes call him Terrible John,
’Cos his tail goes on –
And on –
And on.
And I sometimes call him Terrible Jack,
’Cos his tail goes on to the end of his back.
And I sometimes call him Terrible James,
’Cos he says he likes me calling him names. . . .
But I think I shall call him Jim,
’Cos I am fond of him.
