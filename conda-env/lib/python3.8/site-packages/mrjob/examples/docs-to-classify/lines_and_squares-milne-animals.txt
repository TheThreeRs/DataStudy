Whenever I walk in a London street,
I’m ever so careful to watch my feet;
And I keep in the squares,
And the masses of bears,
Who wait at the corners all ready to eat
The sillies who tread on the lines in the street,
Go back to their lairs,
And I say to them, ‘Bears,
Just look how I’m walking in all of the squares!’
